      placeholder: I read the wiki and installed the mod correctly, but still encountered bugs! I have been lying on the treasure for five minutes now, but nothing happens. I play on my friend's server and they don't have this problem. 1. Put the treasure on the ground 2. Right-click on them 3. Just wait and nothing happens.
