- render issues (flickering wings / tail parts)
  - geckolib (4?) (and blockbench?) don't like elements with size 0 (x, y or z)
    - currently some elements which were previously size 0 are now 0.01 to avoid flickering but this causes texture borders / lines
- animation not wholly correct (unsure)
- info tooltip corner elements are sometimes offset
- reset settings button text is missing
- damage type translations

# 1.19.2 bugs
- human and dragon are shown different customizations in the dragon editor
- changing customization as human has no effect
- gui screen creates new handlers on every open and keeps old ones around (unsure)
