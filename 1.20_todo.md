- render issues (flickering wings / tail parts)
  - geckolib (4?) (and blockbench?) don't like elements with size 0 (x, y or z)
    - these sizes need to be set to sth. like 0.01 to avoid flickering but this causes texture borders / lines
- animation not wholly correct (unsure)
- info tooltip corner elements are sometimes offset
- some tooltips not showing
- damage type translations
